Python Conditions and If statements
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
//
day = 4
match day:
  case 1:
    print("Monday")
  case 2:
    print("Tuesday")
  case 3:
    print("Wednesday")
  case 4:
    print("Thursday")
  case 5:
    print("Friday")
  case 6:
    print("Saturday")
  case 7:
    print("Sunday")


//while
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
//loops
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
